This is a simple Python script for generating a stat block for a new character in the ShadowDark TTRPG. In ShadowDark, character stats are generated by rolling three six-sided die (3d6) and taking the sum, then repeating this for each of the six different stats in the game (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA). If none of the results exceed 13, you can reroll them.

Normally, the stats you roll are done completely randomly, so you don't know ahead of time if you will end up with a stat block good for a wizard (high INT) or a warrior (high STR), for example. With this program, you can prioritize and/or deprioritize certain stats to shape your stat block for a specific class. This does not change the underlying dice rolls in any way, it simply applies the highest results to your preferred stats. 

Good luck!
